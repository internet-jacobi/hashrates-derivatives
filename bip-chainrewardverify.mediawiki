==Abstract==

This BIP describes a new opcode (OP_CHECKCHAINREWARDVERIFY) for the Bitcoin scripting system that allows
a transaction output to be made unspendable until a total amount of satoshi has been rewarded
to miners.

== Motivation ==

TODO:

=== Trustless Reward Bet ===

    IF
    	<chainReward + 3 months of reward> CHECKCHAINREWARDVERIFY DROP
    	<Alice's pubkey> CHECKSIGVERIFY
    ELSE
    	<now + 3 months> CHECKLOCKTIMEVERIFY DROP
    	<Bob's pubkey> CHECKSIGVERIFY
    ENDIF

== Specification ==

TODO: integrate on top of taproot (bip341)

CHECKCHAINREWARDVERIFY redefines the existing NOP5 opcode. When executed, if any of the following conditions
are true, the script interpreter will terminate with an error :
* the stack is empty; or
* the top item on the stack is less than 0; or
* the witness annex nChainReward field is empty; or
* the chainwork type of the top stack item and the witness annex nChainReward field are not the same; or
* the top stack item is greater than the transaction's nChainReward field

Otherwise, script execution will continue as if a NOP had been executed.

The witness annex nChainReward field in a transaction prevents the transaction from being mined until a 
total amount of satoshis has been rewarded in the chain up to the block for which the spending
transaction is candidate for inclusion. By comparing the argument to CHECKCHAINREWARDVERIFY against the
witness annex nChainReward field, we indirectly verify that the desired total amount of work has been
reached. Until a total amount of satoshi has been reward, the transaction output remains unspendable.

== Rationale ==

* should we signal finalty of the input ? nSequence=0xff_ff_ff_ff
